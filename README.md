## Introduction

The Water Quality Monitoring System is a project aimed at monitoring and analyzing water quality parameters using IoT devices and data analytics. It provides real-time insights into various water quality metrics to ensure safe and clean water supply.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Continuous monitoring of water quality parameters such as pH level, turbidity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.
- **Data Visualization:** Visual representation of data trends and historical analysis using charts and graphs.
- **Alert System:** Automated alerts and notifications for abnormal water quality conditions.
- **Data Logging:** Persistent storage of sensor data for historical analysis and regulatory compliance.
- **User Interface:** Intuitive web interface for accessing real-time data and analytics.

## Technologies Used

- **Hardware:**
  - IoT Sensors (pH, Turbidity, Temperature, Dissolved Oxygen)
  - Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP32)

- **Software:**
  - Arduino IDE

## Installation

To run the Water Quality Monitoring System locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/satvikg7/water-quality-monitoring.git
   cd water-quality-monitoring
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create `.env` file.
   - Define necessary environment variables (e.g., ThingSpeak API KEY).

5. **Compile and Upload the code using Arduino IDE**

## Usage

1. **Dashboard Overview:**
   - View real-time readings of pH level, turbidity, temperature, and dissolved oxygen.
   - Check historical data trends through interactive charts.

2. **Alerts and Notifications:**
   - Receive alerts for out-of-range values or critical water quality conditions.

3. **Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze historical data to identify patterns and trends.
   - Generate reports for regulatory compliance or research purposes.
